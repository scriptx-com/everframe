The built-in JWT redaction now checks structure instead of a regex. A header.payload.signature (or five-segment JWE) is redacted only when its header decodes to a JOSE header: optional JSON whitespace, `{`, and an `"alg"` member, as RFC 7515 and RFC 7516 require. Tokens with whitespace in or before the header JSON, an empty payload object (`e30`), an empty signature, or text glued before them (`x_`, `token`, `%3D`, `=`, `\n`) are redacted, and only the token is replaced. Dotted class, package and module names, bundle IDs and version strings, such as `dev.example.app.MainActivity$onCreate$2`, `kotlinx.coroutines.internal.DispatchedTask` or `1.2.3.4567890`, are no longer replaced with `[REDACTED:JWT]` in stack frames, messages, breadcrumbs and logs. The Android, iOS and JavaScript SDKs run the same linear-time scanner (`redactJwt` in `@everframe/protocol`, `JwtScan` on Android and iOS), checked against one shared corpus; the `jwt` entry in the shared redaction patterns names the scanner and keeps only a candidate regex.
