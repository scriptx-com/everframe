Mobile crash reports now include the error's cause chain. React Native sends `Error.cause` chains through the existing native bridge, including the stacks Hermes exposes on `Error.prototype`. Android captures `Throwable` causes next to the existing JVM metadata, and iOS follows the `NSUnderlyingErrorKey` of `NSError` and `CustomNSError` errors. Each chain keeps at most 8 causes, 32 frames per cause and 65,536 serialized UTF-8 bytes, is redacted before it is stored, and marks anything it drops as truncated. Malformed cause data never discards the outer report, and causes do not change how errors are grouped.

Cause redaction scans a bounded prefix of each field (8,192 characters) and of each JavaScript stack (32,768 characters). A token cut in half by either limit is now dropped instead of being kept unredacted, so a secret split at the limit cannot reach a report. This applies to web cause chains as well.
