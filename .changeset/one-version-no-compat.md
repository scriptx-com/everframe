Every Everframe package now ships on one version line. The web, React, React Native, identity, Roku and Vega SDKs, the CLI, the Metro, bundler and Expo plugins, and the Android, iOS, Flutter and KMP SDKs all release with the same version number. The CLI and the Expo plugin pin the `dev.everframe` Gradle plugin of their own version.

The SDK key is `sdkKey` everywhere. The `apiKey` config field is gone from `@everframe/web`, `@everframe/react` and `@everframe/react-native`, along with `resolveSdkKey`. On iOS, `EverframeConfig(appId:)`, its `appId` property and the `ReplaySession` initializers that took `apiKey` are gone; use `EverframeConfig(sdkKey:)`.

`EverframeConfig` on Android has only its primary constructor and generated `copy`. The extra constructors and `copy` overloads that kept the signatures of earlier releases are removed, so Java callers pass every constructor argument. The generated protocol models on Android and iOS likewise keep only their current constructors and initializers.

`attachReactTree` and `detachReactTree` are removed from the Android and iOS SDKs; nothing in a report used the tree. `@everframe/web` removes `handleReportSubmit`, `bakeBlurRegions` and `REPORTER_TOKEN_STORAGE_KEY`, and its reporter token is read only from the key scoped to the SDK key.

`everframe setup react-native` and the Expo plugin write the short native setup and rewrite their own generated lines on a re-run.

React Native configures native only through the blocking `configureSync`; the void `configure` method is gone from the TurboModule spec and both bridges. Error capture always uses the bridge's current methods, so `getErrorCaptureStatus()` no longer has a `legacyAttempted` counter, and `getReportDeliveryStatus()` reports a missing native getter as `unavailable/native-call-failed`. The Android bridge opens the reporter only through `ReporterResolverInstaller.openForActivity`.

Android no longer imports the plaintext outbox files that earlier builds wrote. `CrashSidecar.hydrateInto` and the `Unit`-returning `CrashSidecar.appendSync` are removed; use `appendSyncAccepted`. The report delivery status drops the queue's `migration` field on Android, iOS and React Native.
