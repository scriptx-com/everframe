Fix regressions from the Everframe rename. The Android SDK (and React Native on Android) now sends the `X-Everframe-*` header names the API reads, so native video session replay, verified identity and companion report attribution work again. In development under React StrictMode, `EverframeProvider` no longer keeps running with a killed client after the double mount, so two-way replies reach the reporter again.
