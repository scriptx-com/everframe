The iOS and tvOS SDK frameworks now ship their dSYMs, so crashes in apps that install the `Everframe` pod (including React Native and Expo apps) symbolicate the SDK's own frames. Every xcframework slice carries its dSYM; CocoaPods copies it into the build, where the app's symbol upload phase finds it. `EverframeProtocol` moves to its own `Everframe/Protocol` subspec, which `Everframe/Core` depends on, because CocoaPods copies a subspec's xcframeworks into one folder and the second one's dSYMs replaced the first one's. The release verifier rejects a CocoaPods archive with a slice that has none, the React Native example rebuilds a local SDK that predates them, and the Expo plugin's README says the SDK's dSYMs upload with the app's.
