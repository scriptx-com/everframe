Release health is on by default on Android, iOS and React Native, and debug builds aren't counted.

Android's `EverframeConfig.releaseHealth` defaults to `ReleaseHealthConfig()`, including through the 15-argument constructor; `releaseHealth = null` turns it off. iOS's `EverframeConfig` gains `releaseHealth: ReleaseHealthConfiguration? = ReleaseHealthConfiguration()`, which `Everframe.shared.start` applies, so the separate `setReleaseHealth` call after every `start` is no longer needed; `setReleaseHealth(_:)` still changes it until the next `start`, and `releaseHealth: nil` turns it off. In React Native a configuration without `releaseHealth` is on, and `releaseHealth: { enabled: false }` turns it off.

The SDK records nothing from a debug build (Android: a debuggable app; iOS: the simulator, or a `get-task-allow` development profile) and logs `[everframe] Release health is off in debug builds.` once per start. `includeDebugBuilds` on `ReleaseHealthConfig`, `ReleaseHealthConfiguration` or the React Native option counts them. Turning release health off, or skipping a debug build, erases undelivered local records.
