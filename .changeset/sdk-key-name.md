The SDK key is renamed to `sdkKey` in every SDK; `apiKey` and `appId` are still accepted but deprecated. `appId` now means only the App ID, the UUID that symbol and source-map uploads take.

- Web, React and React Native: the config field is `sdkKey`, for example `init({ sdkKey: 'evf_live_…' })` and `<EverframeProvider config={{ sdkKey: 'evf_live_…' }}>`. A config that still passes `apiKey` keeps working: the SDK reads it as `sdkKey` and logs one deprecation warning. When both are set, `sdkKey` wins.
- iOS and tvOS: `EverframeConfig(sdkKey:)` and `.sdkKey` replace `EverframeConfig(appId:)` and `.appId`, which still compile with a deprecation warning. `EverframeConfigError.missingAppId` is now `EverframeConfigError.missingSdkKey`. `ReplaySession(baseURL:sdkKey:locallyDisabled:)` replaces the deprecated `apiKey:` spelling.
- Android: `EverframeConfig(appId, sdkKey)` already used these names and is unchanged. Internal `ReplaySession`, `ReplayConfigProvider` and `VitalsTransport` parameters named `apiKey` are now `sdkKey`.
- React Native requires native Everframe 1.2 on iOS and Android, the release that adds `EverframeConfig(sdkKey:)`. The Flutter iOS plugin requires native 1.2 through CocoaPods and SwiftPM, and the KMP Swift driver needs it too. These bridges, and their web counterparts, pass the key under the new name.

Nothing on the wire changed. Requests still carry the key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, and the web vitals beacon still sends it in the `apiKey` body field, so clients on 1.1.0 and earlier keep working against the same server.
