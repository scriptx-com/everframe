Opening the reporter while one is already open no longer presents a second reporter on Android. The second caller now waits for the open report and receives its result. Previously a host shake listener firing together with the SDK's own shake trigger opened two reporters: the one on top had an empty capture, so the submitted report lost its session replay, and the hidden one kept replay recording paused until it was closed.
