  Builds can upload their native symbols automatically, and a symbol problem never breaks a build by default.

  - `everframe dsym upload-build` finds the binaries and dSYMs itself: `--xcode` inside a Run Script phase, `--archive` for an `.xcarchive` (fastlane, Xcode Cloud, CI) and `--app` for any other layout. App and extension executables are required. Embedded frameworks are optional and warn when they have no dSYM. dSYM folders are searched recursively. iOS, tvOS and their simulators are supported.
  - `everframe setup xcode` adds an "Upload Everframe Symbols" phase to every application target, and `--print-script` prints it for XcodeGen. The phase turns off user script sandboxing on those targets and declares a dSYM input only for `dwarf-with-dsym` builds.
  - The React Native and Expo build phase also uploads iOS dSYMs, skips Debug builds, reads flavored Android variants such as `tvRelease`, and turns off user script sandboxing.
  - `everframe elf upload-build --binaries-dir` finds every shipped `.so`, limited to `--abi` when given. Prebuilt libraries without debug information are listed, not warned about; `--summary` prints one `detail:` line per library for build integrations.
  - In `--xcode` mode, `everframe dsym upload-build` also follows the app's run-path links to frameworks that are built but not embedded yet, such as CocoaPods frameworks under `use_frameworks!`, and uploads their dSYMs from the build products.
  - R8 mappings may be up to 512 MiB (from 32 MiB). The CLI streams them and sends them gzip-compressed when the server lists `gzip` in `uploadEncodings`. A mapping over the limit fails with `r8_mapping_too_large`, naming the file, its size and the limit.
  - The `dev.everframe` Gradle plugin uploads R8 mappings and native libraries after `assemble<Variant>` and `bundle<Variant>` of release builds through a new `everframe {}` block. The R8 mapping ID is the SHA-256 of `mapping.txt`, packaged with the app, so `Everframe.start` reports it without `r8MappingId`. `everframeR8 {}`, `EVERFRAME_R8_BUILD_ID` and the `EVERFRAME_R8_MAPPING_ID` BuildConfig field are removed. React Native and Expo projects apply the plugin. Native uploads consider only the ABIs the variant packages, and libraries without symbols produce one warning with a count; `--info` lists them.
  - Build integrations warn and exit 0 when `EVERFRAME_API_TOKEN` is missing or an upload fails. They upload every file that matches before reporting misses, and stop after `EVERFRAME_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (600 by default). `--strict` or `EVERFRAME_SYMBOLS_STRICT=1` turns these into failures.
  - Every request now has a timeout, and `upload_busy` responses are retried for as long as their `Retry-After` and the time budget allow.

  The iOS and tvOS SDK frameworks now ship their dSYMs, so crashes in apps that install the `Everframe` pod (including React Native and Expo apps) symbolicate the SDK's own frames. Every xcframework slice carries its dSYM; CocoaPods copies it into the build, where the app's symbol upload phase finds it. `EverframeProtocol` moves to its own `Everframe/Protocol` subspec, which `Everframe/Core` depends on, because CocoaPods copies a subspec's xcframeworks into one folder and the second one's dSYMs replaced the first one's. The release verifier rejects a CocoaPods archive with a slice that has none, the React Native example rebuilds a local SDK that predates them, and the Expo plugin's README says the SDK's dSYMs upload with the app's.

  Publish the build-artifact tooling. `@everframe/metro` stamps a build identity into Hermes bundles at bundle time, `@everframe/expo` adds the native build steps that collect the bundle, source map and native identifiers, and `@everframe/cli` verifies and uploads them so release crashes symbolicate. `@everframe/react-native` now reads the identity injected by `@everframe/metro`, so no build ID needs to be passed at runtime.

  `@everframe/bundler-plugin` adds Vite, Rollup, webpack, esbuild and Next.js plugins that stamp a build ID into web bundles and upload their source maps at the end of a production build. `everframe upload-expo-export` uploads the bundles and source maps from an `expo export` directory. `everframe setup react-native` patches the Gradle and Xcode build steps so native release builds collect and upload their artifacts.
